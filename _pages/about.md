I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University. I received my PhD from Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University in 2016, where I was advised by Prof. Rong Xiong. During my PhD, I was an exchange research student in University of Technology, Sydney and Stanford University from 2013 to 2015. 

My research focus is to build persistent autonomy for robot using artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision. Our group developed many robot systems, such as off-the-road robot navigation system, last-mile package delivery robot, and vision based industrial robots controller, of which some systems have been applied in industry.
